# FirstMixProject

I added this differently than the docs said. 

I made the folder first -- and then ran

```shell
mix new .
```

Which then created what you see here minus this section of docs.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `first_mix_project` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:first_mix_project, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/first_mix_project>.
